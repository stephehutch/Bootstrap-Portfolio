                        In 2009 the infant mortality rate in the Fifth Section was 50%. The Fifth Section St. Marc,
                        Haiti that is largely ignored by the government. The people there are a welcoming tight-knit
                        community who never hesitate to smile and say hello to any stranger they pass on the street. I
                        remember walking from mud house to mud house inviting people to a free clinic down the street.
                        During my walk, I met a woman with an infant clinging to her breast. The child did not look
                        like an invalid except for his curly red hair. His hair should have been black, but
                        malnutrition had changed it to a vibrant shade of orange. With a 50% infant mortality rate I
                        knew that this child’s chances of seeing his second birthday were slim to none. I felt hopeless
                        because there was absolutely nothing I could do to help this child.
                        <p>
                            I try to adhere to philosophy that a business can have more purposes than simply the
                            accumulation of wealth. I would be a good addition to the program because I can offer a
                            fresh perspective due to direct experience with people in underdeveloped countries. I have
                            seen firsthand what a community looks like with a total lack of commerce. A business can
                            build a community from the ground up. I couldn’t do anything to help that baby, but with an
                            advanced degree, I could learn more about how a functioning economy works from the
                            perspectives of three different developed economies.
                        </p>
                        <p> While studying abroad at Germany’s WHU I discovered that for two developed countries, it is
                            surprising how differently Germany and the United States handle economics. Germany has a
                            high income tax and does not have a minimum wage, while the US has a minimum wage, but has
                            a relatively low income tax. Studying abroad in Germany and helped me to learn a different
                            way an economy or business can function. Someday, I hope to apply this knowledge in
                            developing economies.
                        </p>
                        <p> I have had this dream of transforming a community through entrepreneurship since I was
                            young. I started visiting developing nations at the age of twelve. Right away I saw the
                            need for commerce. On my trip to the Philippines we went to a beach side village. I didn’t
                            know why at the time, but the children there had highlights as well, and only one woman in
                            that entire village had a job. I’ll never forget the looks on their faces as I waved
                            goodbye from the back of the Jeep. A few years later, I went back to that village and met a
                            woman who remembered me from last time I was there. She showed me a picture of my face
                            waving out the back of the Jeep. Through this experience I learned I can make a difference.
                            I hope that a furthering my education with a will give me the knowledge and experience
                            necessary to make a difference in not one just person’s life, but the lives of an entire
                            community.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As a parting note, I am happy to report that since I last visited Haiti the infant mortality
                        rate has halved. As the world economy develops more places like the fifth section are getting
                        access to clean water and healthcare. Unfortunately, economics as force for change also has an
                        ugly side. That sea-side village In the Philippines is now being threatened by a corporation
                        that wants to build a casino.
